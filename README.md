The Following are mini-capstone projects from Tech Elevator:

The Nataural Park Reservation System was a great exercise that we used; the first time we interacted wiht an external database and began to store and pull information.  This project was a great experience to test skills and understanding of MVC. 


The Vending Machine exercise was a great use of how OOP works! This was in our earlier stages of learning and it was cool to create objects to see how they work

The National Park Description and Weather website was great experience to see how jsp, html, controllers, and databases all interact! This was a tough exercise on linking everything together in the end we came up with a great website.
